### Project Goal

To create a gamified and minimalistic educational platform for retail investors, inspired by Duolingo. The app will focus on advanced topics like algorithmic trading, offer deep hyper-localization with vernacular languages, and include an LLM-powered chatbot for personalized learning. The architecture will be flexible to allow for a future mobile app.

### Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Frontend (Web):** React with TypeScript
*   **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native (for future development)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
